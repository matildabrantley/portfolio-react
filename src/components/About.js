              Welcome! I'm Matilda Brantley, a full stack web developer. I love seeing an idea in my mind spring to life. 
              Making software is the perfect outlet for this as it's one of the most living, mutable designs one could create. 
              I also have a passion for the biological sciences, especially intelligent systems and evolving systems. These inspire my 
              ideals for software that can adjust to ever-changing needs or generate novel and satisfying experiences for the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              I recently completed Georgia Tech's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp and graduated with a Bachelor of Science
              from the Evergreen State College and Rogers State University. My current projects
              involve React, MongoDB, Progressive Web Apps, Phaser's game engine and Neural Networks.
