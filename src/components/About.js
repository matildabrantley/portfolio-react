            <p>Hi, I'm Matilda Brantley, a web developer in training. 
            I love seeing an idea in my mind come to life. 
            Making software is the perfect outlet for this as it's one of the most mutable and living designs one could create. 
            I also have a passion for the biological sciences, especially adaptation, evolution and intelligent systems. 
            These inspire my ideals for software that can adjust to ever-changing needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am now attending Georgia Tech's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp during my last week. My current projects
             involve React, MongoDB, Progressive Web Apps, Phaser and AI.
